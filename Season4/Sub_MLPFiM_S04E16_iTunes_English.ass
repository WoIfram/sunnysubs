Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.53,0:00:19.71,PinkiePie,,0,0,0,,Ah! I can't wait for Rainbow Dash to make the breeze for them so I can see how cute they are up close!
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.71,0:00:21.27,RainbowDash,,0,0,0,,I've never done it before,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:21.27,0:00:24.89,RainbowDash,,0,0,0,,not that I won't be totally awesome at it, because I totally will!
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.89,0:00:29.88,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,And that breeze is very important, but so is cheering on those teeny-tiny little things,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:29.88,0:00:33.43,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,so they have the confidence to ride that breeze to their native land.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.43,0:00:36.69,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Did I mention how tiny they are? So tiny!
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.74,0:00:41.13,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,I was thinking we could do a special Breezie cheer!
Dialogue: 0,0:00:41.37,0:00:43.76,PinkiePie,,0,0,0,,I love cheers!
Dialogue: 0,0:00:43.76,0:00:47.87,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,But these cheers should be quiet cheers. We don't want to startle them.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.87,0:00:50.00,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,They need to be able to concentrate.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.24,0:00:54.14,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Why don't we try it? You can do it, Breezies.

Dialogue: 0,0:00:57.69,0:01:02.98,AppleJack,,0,0,0,,Heh, sorry, Fluttershy. I had no idea how hard it was to do a cheer quietly.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.98,0:01:08.09,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Oh, it's okay. Quiet doesn't come naturally for everypony. Let's try it again.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:08.09,0:01:10.50,Somepony,,0,0,0,,You can do it, Breezies!
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.05,0:01:13.79,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Perhaps just a little bit quieter.

Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.73,0:02:33.73,Mr. Cake,,0,0,0,,What I don't understand is why they need the Pegasi to make a breeze for them.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:33.73,0:02:38.20,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Well, you see, it's the breeze that activates the Breezies' magic,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.20,0:02:42.14,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,and that magic protects the pollen they're carrying from being destroyed.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:42.14,0:02:46.95,Mr. Cake,,0,0,0,,So, no breeze means no magic means the pollen goes bad?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.95,0:02:50.62,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,That's right! And they only have two days to get that pollen back
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.62,0:02:52.98,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,before the portal to their home closes.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.22,0:02:58.39,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,That's why it's ever-so-important that we help them make their way through Ponyville safely.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:58.39,0:03:02.22,Mrs Cake,,0,0,0,,We certainly wouldn't want to scare them and divert them from their path!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.22,0:03:04.30,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Now you understand.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:04.30,0:03:06.67,Mr. Cake,,0,0,0,,Hm, you certainly know a lot about them.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:06.67,0:03:11.77,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Oh, thank you. I went to see them gathering their pollen in western Equestria.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.13,0:03:23.23,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Rarity? I, uh, hate to weigh in with you when it comes to fashion, but...
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.23,0:03:25.87,Rarity,,0,0,0,,Oh, there's too much purple on this, isn't there?
Dialogue: 0,0:03:25.87,0:03:29.71,Rarity,,0,0,0,,I knew it! But Twilight refused to admit it.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.84,0:03:30.51,Twilight,,0,0,0,,What?! I-
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.51,0:03:32.84,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Oh, no-no-no-no-no. It's the perfect amount of purple.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:32.84,0:03:36.69,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,It's just that there's an awful lot of sequins on your jacket.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:36.69,0:03:41.88,Rarity,,0,0,0,,Oh, darling, please! One can never have too many sequins!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.88,0:03:46.00,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,You can if they reflect the sun, and the light catches a group of Breezies right in their eyes,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.00,0:03:49.87,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,and blinds them long enough to get them off their course so they never get home!
Dialogue: 0,0:03:49.87,0:03:54.76,Rarity,,0,0,0,,I stand corrected! I suppose there is the rare instance where one can have too many sequins.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.76,0:03:56.76,Rarity,,0,0,0,,I'll just take off my jacket.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:58.36,0:04:00.67,Rarity,,0,0,0,,I suppose this won't do either?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:09.10,0:04:10.98,Twilight,,0,0,0,,Everypony, it's time.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:11.37,0:04:13.79,Twilight,,0,0,0,,Please welcome... the Breezies!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.45,0:04:28.83,AppleJack,,0,0,0,,They're as cute as Apple Bloom on the day she was born.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:28.83,0:04:33.41,Rarity,,0,0,0,,And would you look at those adorable little packs they carry their pollen in?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:36.23,0:04:40.41,PinkiePie,,0,0,0,,So... cute! Can't... take... it!
Dialogue: 0,0:04:51.38,0:04:54.48,Spike,,0,0,0,,Pinkie Pie, can I hop on you so I can see the Breezies?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:54.48,0:04:56.61,PinkiePie,,0,0,0,,May explode!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.45,0:05:11.84,Spike,,0,0,0,,Oh, no!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:22.71,0:05:26.32,RainbowDash,,0,0,0,,Slow down the breeze for the other group to catch up!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.32,0:05:30.80,Thunder Lane,,0,0,0,,They're too far back! We can't connect the breeze to both sets of Breezies!
Dialogue: 0,0:05:30.80,0:05:32.40,RainbowDash,,0,0,0,,What if we speed it up?
Dialogue: 0,0:05:32.40,0:05:34.69,Flitter,,0,0,0,,Then the first group'll be going too fast,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:34.69,0:05:36.93,Flitter,,0,0,0,,and they'll get separated from each other!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:10.41,0:06:14.80,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,He's right! You must all gather as close as you possibly can!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:26.17,0:06:29.28,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Oh, I can understand the language of all kinds of creatures!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:29.68,0:06:31.41,Seabreeze,,0,0,0,,You must be so proud.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.41,0:06:33.54,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,And you speak my language too?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.54,0:06:36.66,Seabreeze,,0,0,0,,I can. This lot can only understand you.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:36.66,0:06:39.67,Seabreeze,,0,0,0,,Clearly, they're not the brightest bunch around.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.15,0:06:44.96,PinkiePie,,0,0,0,,That was amazing!
Dialogue: 0,0:06:44.96,0:06:48.84,RainbowDash,,0,0,0,,I'm sorry we couldn't get a breeze going that would get them back to the others.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:49.90,0:06:51.46,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Oh, it's not your fault.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:51.46,0:06:55.76,Twilight,,0,0,0,,I, for one, am very proud of you, Fluttershy. Leaping into action like that.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.76,0:06:59.64,Rarity,,0,0,0,,I feel like I should design you a special hero's gown! Heh...
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.64,0:07:02.38,Rarity,,0,0,0,,Or a sash. At least a sash.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.38,0:07:06.75,Spike,,0,0,0,,Okay, okay, okay! I know what you're all thinking! Why don't you just say it?!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:06.78,0:07:09.25,Spike,,0,0,0,,I'm sorry!
Dialogue: 0,0:07:09.25,0:07:13.53,Spike,,0,0,0,,This is all my fault! I'm so, so sorry!

Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.30,0:07:40.16,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Maybe we should wait just a moment or so. They've been through so much...
Dialogue: 0,0:07:41.22,0:07:43.73,RainbowDash,,0,0,0,,Just gimme the word when you think they're ready.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.05,0:08:02.36,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Oh, my, Twirly, you look like you need a blanket.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:05.57,0:08:06.70,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Oh, no problem.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:09.22,0:08:11.84,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Oh, did you need some more water?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:16.02,0:08:19.53,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Now, who else needed a hoof-knitted sweater?

Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.60,0:09:32.07,Seabreeze,,0,0,0,,or I would just force you all to fly home right now!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:32.07,0:09:35.26,Seabreeze,,0,0,0,,Why do we have to need magic to keep our pollen safe?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.26,0:09:36.74,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Now, Seabreeze...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:36.74,0:09:38.80,Seabreeze,,0,0,0,,Why are you giving in to these wimps?!

Dialogue: 0,0:09:46.32,0:09:49.94,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,It was because of a leaf, and you know that!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:49.94,0:09:54.34,Seabreeze,,0,0,0,,Oh, please! They have no idea what they're doing out there!
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.34,0:10:00.18,Seabreeze,,0,0,0,,Like you said, we need as much time as we can get because they are so incompetent!
Dialogue: 0,0:10:00.18,0:10:04.75,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Well, I didn't say that exactly now, did I?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:06.69,0:10:09.25,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Well, maybe a snack will lighten the mood?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:20.89,0:10:22.33,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,You're excused.
Dialogue: 0,0:10:24.62,0:10:26.24,FlutterShy,,0,0,0,,Well, my Breezies,
