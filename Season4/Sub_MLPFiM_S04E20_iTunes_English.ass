Dialogue: 0,0:21:05.37,0:21:10.44,AppleJack,,0,0,0,,Being honest sure gets hard when it seems like the truth might hurt somepony you care about.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:10.44,0:21:14.30,AppleJack,,0,0,0,,But I think, believing a lie can end up hurting even more.
Dialogue: 0,0:21:14.30,0:21:16.63,AppleJack,,0,0,0,,Maybe someponies don't care about that,
Dialogue: 0,0:21:16.63,0:21:18.81,AppleJack,,0,0,0,,but I sure ain't one of them.
